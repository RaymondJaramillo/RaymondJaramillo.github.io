## Introduction

My name is Raymond Jaramillo. I am Passionate about making things that excite me and help peoples lives. This is why I chose to, and currently am, an intern at CNM's Deep Dive Java + Android Bootcamp. Here I am learning multiple languages and skills to help in my future professional career. Here I am being taught by Professional Developers, not only how to code, but also how to problem solve and work on a team. This is the beginning of a life long journey of learning for both my development as a person and a future professional developer. I am eager for opportunities to learn and work with teams to solve problems our community and world face with programming.
